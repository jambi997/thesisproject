this is the game I made for my thesis in university and fell in love with programming with it
 you can try it out:https://jambi997.github.io/thesisproject/

in the game you move with wasd, attack with left click and do a special attack with right click, and heal with q. and do a dodge with the space button.

The game has a main hub where you can switch weapons if you walk close to them, has a target dummy with a hp bar on it and a ladder which takes the player to the procedurally generated dungeon, which gets bigger as the player level increases. 
At the end of each dungeon there is a ladder that takes the player to one of 2 bosses. They have an hp bar on their back. On higher levels the bosses are stronger, and trash mobs spawn in the arena.

The game doesnt have a save function, every time the player dies the game resets.

You can play the game as it was meant to be played by clicking on the start gomb, or acces to the two bosses immediatly by clicking on the dragon or lizard buttons.
